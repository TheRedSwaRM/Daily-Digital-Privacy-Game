# Daily-Digital-Privacy-Game
Project Privacy is a short 2D point-and-click thriller game developed by two students for their thesis under the Web Science Group of the UP Diliman Department of Computer Science conducting research on the relationship between video game immersion and perceptions on Data Privacy. The game follows a Filipino student living alone in their dorm room during their semester break. Seeking to ward off boredom, the student turns to social media for scrolling and posting, particularly in the fictional Friender app. However, the student learns the inherent risks in social media interaction, especially when their data privacy is disregarded.

In addition, an accompanying survey will be used to gather insights into your experience and perceptions after playing. If you wish to answer the survey after playing the game, feel free to access it here: https://forms.gle/cqZMpP1x5nMUtjgL7

Playing the game will require approximately 20-30 minutes of your time, followed by a 15-20 minute survey. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and all responses will remain confidential. You are also free to withdraw from the study at any time.

*NOTE: For Windows Users. By default, Microsoft Smart Screen flags executable files downloaded from the internet as potentially dangerous. This is a false-positive. Feel free to access the game's source code at https://github.com/TheRedSwaRM/Daily-Digital-Privacy-Game.
