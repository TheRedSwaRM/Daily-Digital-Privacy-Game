# Daily-Digital-Privacy-Game
Good day! We are students from the Web Science Group of the UP Diliman Department of Computer Science conducting research on the relationship between video game immersion and perceptions of important topics, specifically Data Privacy. As part of our coursework, we've developed a 2D point-and-click thriller game and an accompanying survey to gather insights into your experience and perceptions after playing.

Playing the game will require approximately 20-30 minutes of your time, followed by a 15-20 minute survey. Your participation is entirely voluntary, and all responses will remain confidential. You are also free to withdraw from the study at any time.

*NOTE: For Windows Users. By default, Microsoft Smart Screen flags executable files downloaded from the internet as potentially dangerous. This is a false-positive. Feel free to access the game's source code at https://github.com/TheRedSwaRM/Daily-Digital-Privacy-Game.

The game's files (including download instructions) can be accessed here: https://theredswarm.itch.io/project-privacy
